Insurance Cost Prediction: A Regression-Based Approach is an app that I have built that will enable a user to gage how much they would have to pay for medical insurance depending on the demographic and health data that they enter in the app. It has been built to make real-time prediction.  I used the insurance.csv dataset on Kaggle and thus, the app has been trained on that data.
